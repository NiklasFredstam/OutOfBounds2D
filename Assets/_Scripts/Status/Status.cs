{
    //TODO: HERE IS MY IDEA FOR STATUSES
    //List<Status> stauses; on game objects
    //Whenever something happens to this class, we loop through this. The statuses can be of type TileStatus or UnitStatus
    //They have one method that transform a stat, or an input.
    //Statuses must have a timer countdown
    //Like SpeedUp, lasts for 3 turns, that counts down when listening to turn end.
    //They have one "Before Status" event
    //And one "After Status" event that things can subscribe to just like this.
    //The transformation methods are only ever called when encountered in the Status list.
